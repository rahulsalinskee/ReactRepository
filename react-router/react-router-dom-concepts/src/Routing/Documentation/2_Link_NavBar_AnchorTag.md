- Link, NavBar, Anchor Tag:
    - Link:
        - In React Router, a <link> component is used to navigate from different views and components in the application.
        - It renders an anchor tag <a> with appropriate href attribute, allowing user to click on the link and navigate to the specified route without causing a full page reload.
        - This helps in creating a single-page application experience.

    - NavBar:
        - A navigation bar is a common user interface element used to provide navigation links or menus within a web application.
        - It is typically positioned at the top of a webpage and contain links to various sections or pages of the applications.
        - A NavBar can be implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
        - In the context of React Router, a navbar would likely consist of <link> components to facilitate navigation between routes.

    - Anchor Tag: 
        - An anchor <a> tag is fundamental HTML element used to create hyperlinks.
        - In the context of React Router while anchor tag can still be used for navigation, using the <link> component provided by React Router is generally preferred.
        - This is because <link> components manage navigation without causing full page reloads, leading to a smoother user experience in single-page applications.
