- Dynamic Routes & Params:
    - About:
        - Routes are most important part of the react router application.
        - They couple URL segments to components, data loading and data mutations.
        - THrough route nesting complex application layouts and data dependencies become simple and declarative.

    - Dynamic Route:
        - Dynamic Routes in React Router allows us to create routes with variable segments in the URL.
        - These variable segments can change and we can capture these changes to render different components or content based on URL.

    - Parameters:
        - Parameters are values extracted from dynamic segments in the URL.
        - In React Router we can access these parameters through the useParams() hook or the match object in class-based components.
